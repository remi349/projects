#  Tourism Application
## Introduction 
This group project was realised during my bachelors, for the course [Projet d'apprentissage collaboratif thématique (PACT)](https://synapses.telecom-paris.fr/catalogue/2022-2023/ue/1622/PROJ101-A-projet-d-apprentissage-collaboratif-thematique-pact-1ere-partie?from=D4) with Valerio Guerini, Cilia Ihadadene, Tristan Mangin and Clément Poirson. 

The objective of this project was to create an application that could advice people on the places to visit in Paris.
